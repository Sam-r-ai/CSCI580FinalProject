## How To Use Image Renaming tool:

## How to use Image Resizing Tool:
  - USE IF YOUR IMAGE IS NOT BLACK INK AND HAS WHITE BACKGROUND
  - The Image resizing tool only resizes ALL images in a folder to 28 x 28 pixels. Now that you have a folder containing all images, that folder will be your input folder.
  - Replace the input folder path in the python program with the file path to your folder that contains all images
  - Make a new empty folder and put the file path of that folder in the python program output file variable.
  - Run the program and it will resize all your photos.
  - you will now need to figure out how to turn images black and white
